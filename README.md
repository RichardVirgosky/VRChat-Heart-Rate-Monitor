## 🚀 About the Project
VRChat Heart Rate Monitor is a simple app that connects to **any native Bluetooth HR monitor** and integrates your heart rate data into **VRChat, Discord, and other apps.**  

## ✨ Features
✅ **VRChat Integration** – Send HR data via **VRChat OSC** to **Chatbox** or/and **Avatrar Parameters** to display it in game.  

✅ **Discord Rich Presence** – Show your live heart rate in Discord activity.  

✅ **Other Apps/Local Web Server Support** – Share your heart rate data via local web server to integrate with other apps (e.g. **OBS**).  

## 📌 Compatibility
💡 **Recommended Devices:** The best choice are **Dedicated heart rate trackers** (often inexpensive), as they are specifically designed for real-time heart rate monitoring and often support standard Bluetooth connection.  

🩻 **Tested Devices:** Magene H64/H303, Coospo HW9/H808S, Garmin Venu Sq, Polar, Powr Labs and **many more**.

⌚ **Supported Devices:** Most chest straps, wristbands, smartbands, but also smartwatches with **“broadcast HR via Bluetooth”** feature (e.g., Amazfit, Garmin).  

🚫 **Not Recommended/Supported:** Many smartwatches are **not ideal** for tracking heart rate, because it's often just a secondary feature. Some key issues include:  
   - ❌ **No real-time data:** Many smartwatches only measure heart rate every **30-60 seconds** instead of providing a continuous stream.  
   - ❌ **Incompatible Bluetooth protocols:** Some smartwatches do not use the standard **Bluetooth HR data schema**, making them unusable.  
   - ❌ **No HR broadcasting support:** Popular watches like **Apple Watch** and **Samsung Galaxy Watch** don’t typically allow heart rate data to be shared over Bluetooth in a way this app can handle.  

## 🎭 Suggested (PC and Quest Compatible) Prefab for Avatar Integration
Want to display your heart rate directly on your VRChat avatar and you don't have a knowledge how to do that?  
A community member has created an easy-to-use prefab that you can add to your avatar using **Unity**.

## 🔧 Troubleshooting
If you encounter issues, try these steps:  

1️⃣ Restart the app or your computer.  
2️⃣ Ensure your HR monitor isn’t connected to another device (e.g., your phone).  
3️⃣ Toggle Bluetooth off/on (Windows sometimes struggles with BLE connections and cheap trackers won't make it any easier).  
4️⃣ Restart your heart rate monitor (if there's no button, just remove the battery).  
5️⃣ If your device doesn’t show up, it may not be a native Bluetooth HR monitor.
